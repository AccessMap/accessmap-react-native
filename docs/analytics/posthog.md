# PostHog User Analytics
As a replacement for Rakam applicable to both iOS and Android, we are currently
also using PostHog to capture user activity within accessmap.

The PostHog API key should always be stored under the untracked secrets.js file.
For access to the currently used instance of PostHog, contact jialn166@gmail.com.
