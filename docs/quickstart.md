# What is AccessMap?
AccessMap is an accessible navigation app, currently available on web and Android.
You may use it to plan and customize your routes by setting factors such as maximum uphill/downhill
steepness and the presence of raised curbs, or choosing one of the 3 default settings (wheelchair user, 
power wheelchair user, and cane user).

## How to use the Map?
- Touch the map with one finger to pan around to browse the local area. 
- Pinch with two fingers in and out or use the plus and minus button on the bottom right corner to zoom in/out. 
- The circular target button on the bottom right finds your current location and repositions the map view.
  - To give the app permission to use your device's location services, please accept the prompt that shows up after tapping the button.

## How to Plan a Route?
- Click on any part of the map and a white box will appear on the bottom. Choose to "Route from Here" if
you would like to set it as your starting point and vice versa.
- You may also search for locations using the search bar on the top white card.
- After setting a starting and destination point, a card showing the route distance and estimated time it will take
will show up on the bottom. 
  - Click the Trip Info button to see a graph showing the elevation gain over the course of your trip as well as the distance, time, and uphill/downhill inclines.
  - Click the Directions button to see a list of specific steps to follow from the starting location to your destination.
